export const codeNote = `This project is by far the most favorite project I've ever created. This project wouldn't be possible without very smart
    people who have come before me paving the way so that I can create this project with the knowledge and resources to execute my vision. 
    As I continue to create new projects that excite me, I want to continue to prioritize building this project out with future bug fixes, new features, and
    continued improvement of the user interface and experience. Thank you for using this application. - KL`;
