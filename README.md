# mandarin-list

This project was my 2021 Q1 project which spanned ~3 months. On the front-end project utilizes Vue.js, Vuetify, Vuex, VueRouter, TypeScript, Jest, Cypress, Axios, 
and Chinese-based packages for converting Chinese characters into pinyin.

On the backend, I am using a Node.js with Express backend with a MongoDB database with Mongoose to help build the schema and model the data.

Why did I create this project? I am currently learning mandarin and having the ability to build vocabulary, type out examples, have a memorization game would help 
benefit me on my journey to being fluent.
